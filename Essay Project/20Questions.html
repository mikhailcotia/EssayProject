<h2><center>Is it bigger than a breadbox?</center></h2>
<h3><center>Yes.</center></h3>

<p><center>I have always been tall, decidedly tall. Yet, my curiosity has always surpassed my height. Starting at a young age,<br>
I would ask countless questions, from How heavy is the Earth? To Where does rain come from?<br>
<strong>My curiosity, displayed in questions like these, has truly defined me as a person and as a student.</strong><br>
Therefore, it is not surprising that I became <a href ="https://www.google.ca/search?q=transfixed&rlz=1C1GCEA_enCA763CA763&oq=transfixed&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.2269j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8" target="_blank">transfixed</a>
the first time I played <i>20Q</i> (the electronic version of Twenty Questions).<br>
Somehow, a little spherical device guessed what I was thinking.<br>
The piece of technology sparked my curiosity and instilled in me a unique interest in <i>20Q</i>.<br>
This interest would later reveal valuable character traits of mine while also paralleling various <a href="https://www.google.ca/search?safe=strict&rlz=1C1GCEA_enCA763CA763&q=facets&oq=facets&gs_l=psy-ab.3..0l4.21311.22701.0.23575.6.6.0.0.0.0.397.905.0j3j0j1.4.0....0...1.1.64.psy-ab..2.4.905...0i67k1j0i131k1.0.Ws4VECPWXpQ" target="_blank">facets</a>

<h2><center>Does it strive to learn?</center></h2>
<h3><center>Yes.</center></h3>

<center>

<p><b>I became determined to discover how <i>20Q</i> guessed correctly.</b> After some research, <br>
I discovered artificial intelligence, more specifically, artificial neural networks systems which learn and improve themselves.<br>
This idea fascinated me. I wanted to learn more. I read <a href ="https://www.google.ca/search?q=avidly&rlz=1C1GCEA_enCA763CA763&oq=avidly&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.2238j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8" target="_blank">avidly</a>, seeking and absorbing as much information as I could. <br>
When given the opportunity years later, I signed up for the first computer programming class available to me. <br>
I found myself in an environment I loved. I would stay after class, go in during free periods, <br>
make my own apps, and work over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud9_IDE" target="_blank">Cloud-based IDEs</a>. I prized the freedom and the possibilities.<br></p>
<br>

<h2>Is it driven?</h2>
<h3>Yes.</h3>

<p>After my introduction to <i>20Q</i>, <strong>I began to play Twenty Questions (the traditional parlor game)</strong><br>
and became determined to rival the guessing accuracy of the artificial intelligence. At first I was mediocre. <br>
However, through long car rides with family, good-natured yet heated competitions with friends, logical strategy, and time, <br>
I became more effective. <em>I discovered the secrets to success: practice and perseverance.</em><br></p>

    <li>secrets to success
  </ol>

<h2>Does it apply what it learns?</h2>
<h3>Yes.</h3>

<p>As <i>20Q</i> implements what it learns, so do I. Throughout high school, <br>
<strong>I applied the secret of practice to my basketball career.</strong> <br>
I spent countless hours sharpening my skills in 90 summer heat to 20 late-winter cold, <br>
countless afternoons playing pickup games with my friends, <br>
and countless weekends traveling to AAU basketball tournaments. As a result, <br>
I became a starter for my school's varsity team. I applied another secret, this time the secret of perseverance, <br>
by dedicating myself to physical therapy after knee surgery in order to quickly return to football. <br>
Later that year, I became the first player in my grade to score a varsity touchdown.<br></p>
<br>

<h4>Does it attempt to better itself?</h5>
<h5>Yes.</h4>

<p>Once I became proficient at Twenty Questions, I strengthened my resolve to become masterful. <br>
To do so, I needed to become a skillful inquisitor and to combine that with my analytical nature and interpersonal skills, <br>
all of which are vital for success in Twenty Questions. <br>
Because I had been debating politics with my friends since the 8th grade, <br>
<b>I recognized that debate could sharpen these skills.</b><br>
I began to debate more frequently (and later more effectively) in English and government class, <br>
at the lunch table and family gatherings, and whenever the opportunity presented itself. <br>
<i>This spurred in me an interest for how public policy and government work,</i> <br>
leading me to attend Boys State and receive a nomination for The United States Senate Youth Program.<br></p>
<br>

<h4>Does it think deeply?</h4>
<h5>Yes.</h5>

<p>So far, I have realized that thriving at Twenty Questions, <br>
just like life, is all about tenacity, rationality and interpersonal skills. <br>
I have found that, as in Twenty Questions, always succeeding is impossible; however, <br>
by persevering through difficulties and obstacles, favorable outcomes are often attainable. <br>
As I have become better at Twenty Questions, so too have I improved in many other aspects of my life. <br>
Nonetheless, <strong>I realize that I still have unbounded room to grow.</strong> And much like <i>20Q</i>, <br>
<em>I will continue to learn throughout my life and apply my knowledge to everything I do.</em><br></p>
<br>

<h5>Are you thinking of me?</h5>
<h6>Yes.</h6>
